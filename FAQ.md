# Pixels Camp F.A.Q.

It's normal for those attending [Pixels Camp](https://pixels.camp) to have a few questions or concerns. We'll try to address most of these below.


## GENERAL QUESTIONS

* **What is Pixels Camp?**

Pixels Camp is a yearly technology event, spanning over three days of non-stop technical talks, workshops, competitions, and coding. For 60 hours straight, around 1000 participants can enjoy world-class presentations, demos, community events, and its classic 48-hour coding competition.

* **Who can attend Pixels Camp?**

Pixels Camp is targeted at creative minds with a hacker spirit (in the [classical definition](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) of the word). Anyone with a technical profile is welcome to apply, not only engineers (eg. web designers are welcome too).

* **How are applicants selected?**

Pixels Camp curators aim at selecting the best, most participative and motivated, programmers and creatives. For this they rely on what candidates fill in their profiles (their pitches and personal bios) and evidence of engagement in previous editions (if applicable).

CVs don't matter, please don't paste full CVs as an application pitch. What matters is your potential and your passion for technology, no matter your level of experience.

* **How much does it cost?**

Pixels Camp is **free** for all selected candidates.

* **Can I register our company employees in bulk?**

No. Candidates must register and apply individually (they are evaluated and selected individually too, see above).

* **Do you pay for the atendees' transportation and/or accomodation costs?**

**No.** However, there may be discounts and other partnerships. If so, these will be announced in the months leading to the event, so make sure you follow us in one of the social networks where we're present.

You can also choose to sleep in the venue. This one is guaranteed, with some caveats (see below).

* **Can I bring a guest to the event?**

No. All attendees must apply to the event individually.

* **Do I have to participate in the 48h programming competition?**

No. But we do encourage you to participate in _something_ during the event, and not just passively roam around the venue. Fortunately, there are plenty of activities to choose from.

* **I was selected but can't attend the event, what do I do?**

Please let us know. Spots are limited and it would be nice if another candidate could go instead (but no, you cannot choose who that candidate might be).

* **When will the schedule be available?**

A detailed schedule will be available closer to the event, on our [website](https://pixels.camp).

* **Will there be a live stream from the event?**

Yes, live streaming will be available. The feed will be focused on the activities taking place on the main stage, such as talks and contests. When nothing is going on there, you can expect a general transmission of the event.

* **Will the talks be recorded?**

Unless the speaker states otherwise, every talk will be recorded and available online in the weeks following the event.

* **Is there food and beverages at the event?**

Food and drinks will be provided free for all attendees. We'll be providing lunch and dinner daily, and there will be random snacks and beverages available 24/7. 

* **Why is the official language English?**

Although most of our participants are from Portugal, we have attendees coming from all over the world. English is usually well understood and accepted. Our main motivation is technology and talent, and these are global attributes, so our main "language" is what we use to code.

English is not the only language at the event, though. The event is bilingual, so there may be talks held in portuguese. These will be properly identified in the event's schedule.

* **Do I get a participation certificate at the end?**

Yes, we can provide participation certificates on demand in the days following Pixels Camp. Just make sure you actually participate.


## VENUE AND FACILITIES

* **Should I arrange for a place to stay?**

In the spirit of the event, attendees can choose to stay the night at the venue, sleeping in sleeping bags or such. But if this is not your thing, you have many accommodation options elsewhere around. Closer to the event we may announce discounts and partnerships.

Please note that Lisbon has plenty of tourism all year round, which means high occupation in hotels and hostels, so try and book your reservations in advance.

* **Are there hotels nearby?**

Pixels Camp's venue (Pavilh√£o Carlos Lopes) is in a very central location in the city, so there are plenty of hotels around. These are just a few examples:

High-end(ish):

 * [Zenit Lisboa][100]
 * [Lisbon Fontana Park][101]
 * [Hotel Miraparque][105]

Affordable(ish):

 * [Lisbon Top Hostel][102]
 * [Home Sweet Lisbon][103]
 * [Midtown Hostel][104]

* **Are there showers available?**

The logistics for this are complicated, so don't count on it. Bathrooms are available, but showers may not exist at all or be _very_ limited in time. You'll have to improvise.

* **I've decided to stay at the venue. Can I bring a small tent to Pixels Camp?**

Although the event has "Camp" in its name, tents are **not allowed** due to space limitations inside the venue. However we'll do our best to provide you with optimal spots for taking naps.

* **What about a sleeping bag?**

This one is allowed, no problems with that.

* **Is there Wi-Fi at the event?**

Of course. There will also be a limited number of ethernet outlets in the table area, but teams doing projects for the 48h competition have priority on these.

* **Will the Wi-Fi be any good this year?**

The million-dollar question... The organization will provide a world-class setup but, ultimately, this depends on you and your fellow attendees. Bear in mind that hotspots are **NOT ALLOWED** at the event. Wi-Fi is a shared medium, like a pool, please don't pee in the pool.


## 48h COMPETITION, QUIZ SHOW, SECURITY CTF AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

* **What are these other activities?**

The main activity is, of course, the 48h programming competition, where your team works on a project during the event and presents it on stage on the final day.

In the Quiz Show teams answer tech/science related questions and in the Security CTF teams try to solve cybersecurity-related challenges. There's also a retro gaming competition where participants play classic games on stage. These are just some examples.

* **How can I participate in these activities?**

Some will have qualifier challenges in the weeks leading to Pixels Camp (eg. the Quiz Show and the Security CTF), you just need to participate and score enough to get qualified. Others require only that you register during the event. Check the [website](https://pixels.camp) for more details.

* **If I'm selected to participate in one of these activities, can I select anyone to team up with me? Even a speaker?**

Yes, but it'll help if you tell that person beforehand. ;)

* **Does that mean I can invite someone who's not attending Pixels Camp?**

No. The other members in your team must also be approved attendees. And to be approved they must apply for the event (individually).

* **Are there prizes for winning one of these activities?**

In most cases, yes. But we won't tell you what the prize is in advance. ;)


## SPEAKERS AND SPONSORS

* **I want to be a speaker at the event. How can I propose a talk?**

Talks proposals are handled through GitHub pull requests. Follow the instructions in the [talks repo](https://github.com/pixelscamp/talks).

* **Do I need to apply to Pixels Camp to propose a talk?**

Yes, you do. And if your talk is accepted, it means you're immediately accepted as an attendee as well (of course).

* **Since english is the official language, should my talk be given in english?**

English is the official language, yes, but it's optional for participants and speakers. If you're not comfortable (enough) with delivering a talk in english, you can choose to deliver it in portuguese instead.

You could also choose Klingon, or Goa'uld, but it makes sense to choose a language that at least a few people in the audience would be able to understand... ;)

* **I am interested in exhibiting or becoming a sponsor, what do I do?**

If you are interested in sponsoring Pixels Camp, please [contact us](mailto:org@pixels.camp) for a prospectus and sponsorship application instructions.


## ADVERTISING AND RECRUITING

* **I'm a tech guy but I also do recruiting. Is it OK if I talk to someone at Pixels Camp to see if they're interested in working with me?**

You **cannot** engage in direct recruitment activities during Pixels Camp. This is one of the core rules of the event. The attendees don't enjoy unsolicited targeting, and we don't want to turn the event into a battlefield for hires. Trust us, it's better for you, not only for attendees.

Having said this, it's OK if the interest is mutual and both parties want to talk (meaning the attendee approaches you). It's definitely NOT OK if you're preaching to the crowd or fishing around for interest.

* **Can I leave a few flyers on the tables to advertise my group/event/company?**

That would depend on what you're advertising. The only hard rule on this is that you talk to us first at [org@pixels.camp](mailto:org@pixels.camp).
