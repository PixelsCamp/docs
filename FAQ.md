# [Pixels Camp](https://pixels.camp) F.A.Q.

It's normal for those attending to have a few questions or concerns. We'll try to address most of them here.

### GENERAL

**What is Pixels Camp?**  
Pixels Camp is a yearly technology cult event, spanning over three days of non-stop technical talks, workshops, and coding.
For sixty hours straight, 1000 participants enjoy world-class presentations, demos, community events and its classic 48-hour coding competition.


**Who can attend Pixels Camp?**  
Pixels Camp is targeted at creative minds. Based on their pitch, bios, and previous work evidence, the curators aim at selecting the best, most participative and motivated programmers and creatives.

**How much does it cost?**

Pixels Camp is free for all selected candidates. 

**Can I register our company employees in bulk?**

No. Candidates must register and apply individually.

**Can I bring a guest to the event?**  
No, you can't. 

**When will the schedule be available?**  
A detailed schedule will be available closer to the event, on [our website][1].

**Will there be a live stream from the event?**  
Yes, live streaming will be available. The feed will be focused on the activities taking place on the main stage, such as talks and contests. When nothing is going on there, you can expect a general transmission of the event.


**Will the talks be recorded?**  
Unless the speaker states otherwise, every talk will be recorded and available on the internet shortly after they're given.


**Is there food and beverages at the event?**  
Food and drinks will be provided free for all attendees. We'll be providing two main meals daily, and will have snacks and beverages available for the rest of the time. 


**Why is the official language English?**  
Although most of our participants are from Portugal, we have attendees coming from all over the world. English is usually well understood and accepted. Our main motivation is technology and talent, and these are global attributes, so our main "language" is what we use to code. 


### VENUE AND FACILITIES

**Should I arrange for a place to stay?**  
In the spirit of the event, attendees can choose to stay the night at the venue, sleeping in makeshift beds made of bean bags or such. But if this is not for you, you have many accommodation options elsewhere around. Closer to the event we may announce discounts and partnerships with hotels and hostels in Lisbon.


**Are there showers available?**  
Unfortunately no, bathrooms are available, but not showers. You'll have to improvise.


**I've decided to stay at the venue. Can I bring a small tent to Pixels Camp?**  
Although the "Camp" in the event's name, tents are not allowed due to space limitations. However we'll do our best to provide you with optimal spots for taking naps in the venue.


**What about a sleeping bag?**  
It is at your discretion, but you'll certainly sleep more comfortable.


### QUIZ SHOW, SECURITY COMPETITION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

**If I'm selected to participate on one of these activities, can I select anyone to team up with me? Even a speaker?**  
Yes, but it'll help if you tell that person beforehand.

**Does that mean I can invite someone who is not attending Pixels Camp?**  
No. The other participants in your team must be approved attendees.


### SPEAKERS AND SPONSORS

**I want to be a speaker at the event. How can I propose a talk?**  
Talks proposals are handled through GitHub pull requests. Follow the instructions [here][3].


**Because english is the official language, should my talk be given in english?**  
English is the official language, and we encourage it, but it's optional for participants and speakers. You can use Portuguese or Klingon (if that's your thing), it's really up to you.


**I am interested in exhibiting or becoming a sponsor, what do I do?**  
If you are interested in sponsoring Pixels Camp, please [contact us](mailto:org@pixels.camp) for a prospectus and sponsorship application instructions.


### ADVERTISING AND RECRUITING

**I'm a tech guy but I also do recruiting. Is it OK if I talk to someone at Pixels Camp to see if they're interested in working with me?**  
You can not engage in direct recruitment activities during Pixels Camp. The participants don't enjoy it, and we don't want to turn the event into a battlefield for hires. It's OK if the interest is mutual and both parties want to talk; it's definitely not OK if you're just preaching to the crowd or asking everybody to see you get someone interested.


**Can I leave a few flyers on the tables to advertise my group/event/company?**  
That would depend on what you're advertising. Talk to us at [org@pixels.camp](mailto:org@pixels.camp).
