Campfire Events are all year calendar of tech talks around Portugal and Europe in small venues or office facilities, organized by the Pixels Camp team and their partners.

If you feel you should put your mad skills at work and share your knowledge with the community, be it technology, product design, entrepreneurship or your vision about the future, then talk to us. We will provide you with access to thousands of other developers, a stage, video capturing, streaming and a great, engaged audience.

Here’s how it works:

* The promotor, you, for instance, fills up the form for hosting a Campfire.
* If you don’t have a place to host your event, we can help through our network of partners and provide you with free access to a number of great spaces with great accessibility and infrastructure.
* We provide web streaming guidelines and tools.
* We provide brand use guidelines, do and don’ts, and access to the Pixels Community.
* We promote your talk through our channels are make sure everyone knows about it.

## The form

To host the Campfire and initiate the process, start by opening up an issue in this repository, using the label *campfire*, using [this template][4]. Or, if you want to keep the discussion private, send us [an email][11] with the same information, and we'll followup on it.

In the case of the public issue ticket, the team will then use the comments section to discuss the details with you.

Once the details are ironed out, your campfire will be posted in the [general calendar][5] and we'll handle promotion, streaming and archiving the best we can.

## Promotion

Promotion is done through our Website, Slack, Social Networks and Newsletter channels. We can reach a community of over 5000 developers.

Each Campfire should create an event page for registrations. Usually, this is done through Eventbrite. The Pixels Camp team can take care of this for you.

## Branding

We're relatively liberal when it comes to using the Pixels Camp brand materials with your Campfire. We have no formal brand guidelines for the moment, just general good sense. Having said this, here are some materials that you can use.

* [Campfire logo][7]
* [Pixels Camp logo][8] (SVG)
* [Campires Media Kit][9] (Zip file]
* [Pixels Camp Media Kit][10] (Zip file]
