# How to Apply to Pixels Camp

Applying to Pixels Camp is one of the most important steps towards spending three days with an amazing community of developers and tech enthusiasts in an unforgettable experience of hacking, learning, sharing, and having fun.

A few rules you need to know about Pixels Camp first:

  * The event is **100% free** for participants, but there's a screening process.
  * It's targeted at **technology-inclined creative minds**. This means developers, designers, makers, hackers, scientists, hobbyists of all ages and trades.
  * Based on their pitch, bios, and previous work evidence, the curators aim at selecting the best, most participative and motivated participants.
  * Applications to Pixels Camp are **individual** and private. There are no company or group applications.
  * You can't request for a friend to be accepted, but you can ask your friends to read this document and help with their bios and pitches. Effort and detail counts in our evaluation (quality over quantity).
  * Our authentication and SSO is based solely on GitHub APIs, which means you need a [GitHub account][2].

When applying, we're going to ask you for some contact information, and two critical free text answers. They are your public bio and your private registration pitch.

On your public bio you should reference who you are, what you do, and how the community can reach you (eg. your blog or twitter profile). Everyone can see this. Think of it as your welcome card.

On the *private* registration pitch you should spend some time perfecting your answer. This is where we ask for effort and detail. Think of the private pitch as the place where you describe your history in the tech world to us, your best work and accomplishments, what excites you when you look at the future, your motivation to be at Pixels Camp, and why we should accept your application.

Here's a quick checklist of some of the information we expect to see in your private pitch:

  * Technologies you work (or play) with;
  * Projects youâ€™ve done;
  * Things youâ€™re interested in;
  * Why you want to attend Pixels Camp;
  * If youâ€™ve been at previous similar events, what you did there;
  * Why we should accept your application.

If you haven't already done so in your public bio, the private pitch must include your real identity (i.e. your real name). 

**Remember**: We donâ€™t have the bandwidth to go sneaking on your personal webpage or blog looking for information. You have to make it available in your bio or private pitch. Not providing enough information may prevent us from being able to accept your application. On the other hand, providing too much information may also slow down the selection process, so be succinct yet complete. ðŸ˜‰

The private pitch is **private**. Only a small group of Pixels Camp curators have access to it and it isn't shared with any outside entity (eg. sponsors).

We hope to see you at the next Pixels Camp. Good luck.
