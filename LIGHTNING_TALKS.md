# Lightning Talks

In addition to traditional talks, Pixels Camp will have a segment for lightning talks.

Lightning talks are short (5 minutes) presentations where you can share your thoughts on any subject. Maybe you want to demonstrate your latest project or share an idea you had, just try to keep it inside the Pixels Camp spirit.

This is a great opportunity for new speakers to present without the preparation required for a longer talk. And if for some reason the talk goes terrible wrong, at least it’s only 5 minutes.

Please note that only approved candidates can submit lightning talk proposals.

Lightning Talks will take place in the Chill-out zone after 5 pm on Thursday and Friday.

## How to submit a Lightning Talk

The process to submit a Lightning Talk is easy and informal:

* Go to [Slack's][1] channel #lightning_talks and just say something along these lines: "Hi, I would like to do a Lightning Talk on Machine Learning for Cows."
* One of the Lightning Talks masters, [Bruno Tavares][2] or [José Pedro Dias][5] will enter in a conversation with you and you will be assigned a day and hour.
* The list of Talks will be posted on the event website [schedule page][4] for everyone to look.
* We will use [Slack][1], [Twitter][4] and the venue's digital signage system to announce Lightning Talks when they come. You can do the same yourself.
