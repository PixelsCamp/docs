# Pixels Camp Slack

The Pixels Camp organization provides a Slack instance to help the community take the best from the event. This guide provides a policy and some guidelines on how to use Slack in this context.

### GENERAL

**What is Slack?**

Slack provides a rich communication platform where its members can exchange messages and files. It's both a way for the Pixels Camp community to interact with each other, as well with the organization. It's most active during the weeks around Pixels Camp, but it's available throughout the year.

More about Slack [here][1]

**Who can join?**

It's open to anyone willing to talk about hard-core tech with the Pixels Camp community. If you fit this profile, then by all means, join us.

**How can I join?**

When you're accepted as an [attendee][5], you'll automatically get an invite via email if you haven't joined already. To join before being accepted, you can ask anyone already there to send you an invite.

**Do I really need to join?**

You don't _need_ to join. Slack is just another way to connect with the Pixels Camp community and foster discussion and creativity.

Having said this, it has proven to be useful for the past few Pixels Camp editions. People use it to ask questions, help each other (eg. challenges happening before and during the event), and generally have a good time. It's also one of the primary means of communication for quick updates during the event.

**What are my other options?**

We use email for critical messages. We use a few social networks too. [Facebook][4] works nicely for general messages and announcements. We use [Instagram][3] because, er, it's cool and everyone loves great photos.

We use [Twitter][2] as well and, along with email and Slack, it's one of our primary means of communication. You should follow our [account][2] if you can.

**Slack notifications are bugging me and draining my battery!**

We have good news for you. Slack has marvelous controls over notification settings, per channel, if you need to. Here's something you can start by doing: turning off notifications in the #general channel unless there's a mention of yourself.

You can do this to other channels as well, and you can turn off all notifications except direct mentions of yourself if you wish (some members of the organization would say this is the sanest option).

### CODE OF CONDUCT

**Use english**

Whenever possible, especially in `#general`, use **english**. Remember, although Pixels Camp happens in Portugal, it has participants from all over.

**No shouting**

Hundreds of people in a channel can be quite noisy and we want it to be useful, not annoying. This means we have to be extra careful with anything that potentially triggers a notification, or ultimately, tries to capture your precious attention. As a precaution, `@channel`, `@here` and `@everyone` mentions are disabled in the larger channels.

**Jibber-jabber, can I?**

We understand. You get all excited with bots, memes, giphy images, and random jokes about programming languages you don't use or understand. We want you to express yourself in creative ways, even if no one is listening, so there's the `#random` channel for that. Go for it. Or... you can create your own public or private channel and invite your pals to join you. That might work too.

On `#general` the moderators will generally try to keep things clean and **will** delete messages they find inappropriate or noisy.

**Announcements**

The organization provides you an official `#announcements` channel. We'll use this channel to broadcast information before and during Pixels Camp. Sometimes sponsors will too. It's a fairly low traffic channel, don't worry.

**Nickname**

The whole point of this is to promote interaction and networking between the participants of Pixels Camp, which means we should aim for some level of knowledge and transparency about everyone on Slack. We won't ask you to expose your email; you probably wouldn't like that, but we're going to ask you to use the **same nickname you've used when you registered for Pixels Camp** (ie. the same as your GitHub account). 

We can't enforce this technically, but we're expecting you to comply.

**Use a real photo**

Read above on the nickname arguments. Consider using a real photo of yourself.

### COMMON CHANNELS

Here's a list of common channels you should be aware of:

#### #announcements

General announcements about Pixels Camp. Everyone should subscribe it. Low traffic.

### #hackathon

Questions and general discussion about the 48h hackathon.

### #quizshow

Support group for the quizmaster's "victims". Most active before Pixels Camp, with participants seeking hints and helping eachother get through the quiz qualifiers.

See also the `#codeinthedark` and `#security-ctf` channels.

#### #badges

Every badge redeemed will echo in here. High traffic during the event. If you're competing for badges, this is where you can follow your rivals.

#### #jobs

The one and **only** place you can post occasional job offers. Opt-in. Remember: Pixels Camp is **not** a recruitment event and recruitment activities by sponsors or participants are **not permitted**.

#### #hardware

Hardware geeks hang out here.
