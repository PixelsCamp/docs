# Speakers F.A.Q.

If you’re speaking at Pixels Camp and have questions, it might very well be that these questions have been posed before.

Let’s address a few of them.

## Talks

### How long are the presentation slots?

Presentations are scheduled 1 hour apart from each other. This means you have almost 1 hour to give your talk, do some Q&A and leave the stage in time for the next speaker to setup. We suggest 45 minutes for talks as the most appropriate duration.

Do keep in mind that attendees need to have some minutes to spare to grab something to eat and move to another stage to see whatever talk they may want to attend next.

### What sort of logistics will be available for my presentation?

A projector, an ethernet cable (there’s also wifi available), VGA and HDMI adapters, an audio jack (should you want to play a movie with sound during your presentation) and an assortment of microphones of which you can choose from: a Lavalier microphone, a Headset, a hand microphone and another microphone on the pulpit.

Hopefully, there will also be attendees, one of whom should be your appointed Pixels Camp volunteer. If any technical problem should arise during your presentation, this person will either solve it or find someone else to do so.

If possible, do let your volunteer know about your microphone choice in advance.

### Anything else regarding my talk?

Yes, at least three things.

When doing Q&A, if an attendee asks you something without a microphone, please try to repeat the question for the camera; there’re people watching live and the recording will be up a bit later.

If you can, we’d appreciate that you’d send your slides to your volunteer after your talk, so we can upload them to the website.

Also, try to stick to your proposed talk; a technical presentation that evolves into a recruitment pitch is usually not seen with good eyes by most people.
