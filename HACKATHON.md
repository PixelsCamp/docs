# Hackathon

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/docs/master/img/hackathon.png)

The goal of the Pixels Camp hackathon is to single out and reward creativity and innovation by 
providing participants with an opportunity to work together within a time frame of 48 hours to 
create something awesome.

The Hackathon is the most important part of the event. Every candidate is advised to put a team 
together and take part in it. Participation is what makes Pixels Camp great. The more we have 
evidence that you participated in the hackathon and other activities, the more your chances of 
joining us next year improve.

It is free form, so you can develop your own idea or [pick challenges][1] that our sponsors have 
prepared for this edition instead. Just make sure you have a prototype, product or a 
service to show us when the clock runs down!

We don't expect you to come to Pixels Camp to attend a few talks, that's not the spirit. We expect 
you to join us for three days, all-in, participate, communicate, learn and teach, and network with 
the community.


Now...

## What's changing this edition?

Last edition's blockchain based voting approach was a success. In fact, it worked so well that we 
decided to build an MVP out of it. 

This edition we're going to introduce you to TAIKAI, a blockchain-based open innovation platform.

The principles are the same, TAIKAI makes full use of decentralization and transparency that 
blockchain technologies promise, including picking up the winning projects of this edition's 
Hackathon.

The dynamics are of what you can find in the real world and a real economy. You can earn KAIs 
(TAIKAI's currency token) by participating in Pixels Camp activities, or by convincing others to 
transfer their tokens to you.

When the voting starts, you can invest in the projects you like the most using your hard-earned 
tokens.

In a nutshell: every participant can be an entrepreneur, an investor, a service provider, a 
customer, a marketing guy, a growth strategist, a CTO looking for help, a mentor and a trader.

So here's what changed:

* The Pixels Camp hackathon will run on TAIKAI's website.

* The Hackathon projects will also be submitted through TAIKAI.

* There's no need for wallets or dedicated software to vote or transfer tokens.

* You can only invest in the project when the voting opens. This will happen when the projects 
presentation starts on the Main Stage.

What stays the same:

* Angels will also be listed on TAIKAI. They have more tokens than most users and will invest in 
the projects they think deserve it.

* The voting system is simply transfering your tokens to the projects you love.

* Every investment in a project, either coming from Angels, it's team members, good friends or 
general participants will be entirely traceable, transparent and incorruptible, by design.

It may sound a little complicated, but there will be a section on TAIKAI in the opening Keynotes.

Let's get started with the Hackathon rules now.

## Eligibility

Any Pixels Camp approved participant can apply, as long as they are on the premises during those 48 
hours (within reason â€“ you are allowed to go out and get some air, sleep in a proper bed if you 
want to, etc.)

Groups __must be larger than 2 elements__, all of whom must be Pixels Camp participants. Teams are 
advised to recruit elements with a wide diversity of interests that complement each other in their 
knowledge areas. The broader the skills in a team, the higher the probabilities to surprise the 
angels, investors and your peers with innovative ideas.

You can use [Slack][2], [Twitter][3], [Pixels Camp][4] website or TAIKAI user directory to find 
your team members or you can meet them IRL on site when Pixels Camp starts.

__Participants can only be part of one project__.

Ideas, concepts, and team organization are tasks that can be thought out before the event, but the 
project itself should be developed during the 48 hour period.


## Project Registration

The hackathon projects must be submitted through TAIKAI's website.
To register a new project for your team, log into TAIKAI using your __GitHub__ account.

Head on to Pixels Camp Hackathon challenge page to create a project.

From there you provide a title for your project, an intro (it will be used in the listings) and a 
full description.

<!--
INSERT_PROJECT_CREATION_SCREENSHOT_HERE
-->

You can use [Markdown][7] in the description, to make it more attractive.

Now you need to enter the members of your team, a pretty cover image for your project, an optional 
video if you have one and your code repository, also optional.

When you think that everything's ready for the world to see, click "Publish".

<!--
INSERT_PROJECT_PUBLISH_SCREENSHOT_HERE
-->

Press the "Edit" button whenever you feel like changing your project page.

<!--
INSERT_PROJECT_EDIT_SCREENSHOT_HERE
-->

## Check your project page

Once your project is published, you'll have access to its permalinked page.

This is the page that everyone sees when your project is enabled.

<!--
It deliberately tries to imitate a Kickstarter campaign because that's precisely what you'll be 
doing during the 48-hour hackathon: campaigning for your project to win, until the very last 
projects presentation session.
-->

In the page, you'll see the title of your project, cover, logo, description and the team.

<!--
INSERT_PROJECT_PAGE_SCREENSHOT_HERE
-->

Once it's public, you can share your project page with other participants.


## Project listings

TAIKAI will promote the projects as soon as they are published.
The sooner you get your project page up and running, the more chances you get to be invested.

Projects will be listed on TAKAI's Pixels Camp Hackathon Challenge page and will also be highlighted 
on TAIKAI's homepage.

A number will be attributed to the project based on the creation date.
This will be the order by which they'll be presented on the Main Stage.

<!--

-->

## Project development

Every team member is entitled to a seat at a table. You can ask any staff member to claim seats for 
your team. They will give you a special marker for your project.

You can develop your own idea, but if you choose to respond to any sponsor challenges, make sure 
you read the [provided documentation][1] and don't forget to mention them in your project description.

The sponsors will assign mentors that will be avaible during the event to help you with any 
questions you might have regarding your project. They will be wearing a lime green t-shirt with the 
word "mentor" so they're easily identifiable.

## Schedule

The programming event will last exactly 48 hours, starting on the first day. You can see the full 
schedule [here](https://pixels.camp/schedule/).

Everyone should have their projects public and enabled by the 3rd day, Saturday, at 1 pm.

If you're not planning to present your project in the finals, then please disable your project.

At 2 pm, everyone presenting a project should head to the main stage for testing their laptops.

At 3 pm the final projects presentation begins. Everyone should be ready to get on stage. Projects 
will be called by the same order as they've been registered.

Each project will be presented on stage by a single representative team member, who'll have 90 
seconds to pitch and/or demo your project.

To get a sense of what we're talking about, take a look at last year's [project presentations video][10].

## Awards

Pixels Camp will award the ten most well funded projects. The count will take place exactly 30 
minutes after the last project presentation on Saturday.

Each of the winning projects will receive a handful of prizes, some of which offered by our 
sponsors and partners, and big beautiful Pixels Camp v3.0 trophy to keep by the fireplace at home, 
proudly.

We will also award some of the winners from fun competitions like the Quiz Show, CTF, Chasing 
Ghost, etc.

Finally, TAIKAI will award the top investors, that is, those who were able to accumulate more KAI 
tokens after the final redistribution.
