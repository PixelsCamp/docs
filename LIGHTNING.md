# Lightning Talks

In addition to traditional talks, Pixels Camp will have a segment for lightning talks.

Lightning talks are short (5 minutes) presentations where you can share your thoughts on any subject. Maybe you want to demonstrate your latest project or share an idea you had, just try to keep it inside the Pixels Camp spirit.

This is a great opportunity for new speakers to present without the preparation required for a longer talk. And if for some reason the talk goes terrible wrong, at least it’s only 5 minutes.

Please note that only approved candidates can submit lightning talk proposals.

Lightning Talks will take place in the Chill-out zone after 5 pm on Thursday and Friday.
